[Satnaam](https://www.letsgomago.com/) isn't taking any corporate money because it ends up being a bribe. We must keep our communities safe from ICE, make sure all community colleges offer more vocational training as well as 4 year degrees with increased course offerings to lower tuition across the board, and our state pension plan is no longer invested in Israeli bonds, rather invested in small businesses as they're connected to the working class in ways that big businesses aren't.

In September, members of the West Suburban Illinois DSA voted to endorse [Joey Ruzevich](https://www.joey4congress.com/) for IL-06. We believe he will fight for the changes the working class desperately need like universal healthcare, a living wage, immigration reform, and an end to genocide and war.

# Overview of the WSIL DSA Endorsement Process
Our members democratically decide on campaigns we endorse in each election cycles.  The process below roughly outlines the process.

1. Candidates seeking endorsement must fill out and return a candidate questionnaire to the Electoral Working Group.  The questionnaire can be requested by emailing the WSIL DSA Electoral Working Group at [wsil.electoral@proton.me](mailto:wsil.electoral@proton.me).

2. The Electoral Working Group reviews candidate questionnaires and follows up with the candidate as needed.

3. The Electoral Working Group then votes on whether to advance interviewed candidates to the general membership for a vote on endorsement.  If so, the candidate will be invited to the next general chapter meeting to give their pitch to the general membership and answer any questions from the Electoral Working Group and membership.

4. Finally, the entire chapter votes on endorsement, after which candidates are notified of the result.
