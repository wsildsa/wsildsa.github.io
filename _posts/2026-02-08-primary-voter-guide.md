West Suburban Illinois DSA (WSILDSA) has elected to give recommendations in upcoming Democratic Primary races. All the races we have given light below have at least two people running. There are not too many primaries unfortunately, but hopefully some of the allies we've found can get to office and fight for socialist (and aligned) causes!

All candidates highlighted are pro-palestine, all are pro medicare for all, and, according to research by the Electoral Working Group for WSILDSA up to Jan. 2026, are worth our support in the primary to, at minimum, turn the Democratic Party more left.
