## Junaid Ahmed for Illinois 8th Congressional District

[Junaid Ahmed](https://junaidforus.com/) is a husband, father of two, DePaul graduate, and a proud Illinoisian who has been dedicated to giving back to his community throughout his life. He has dedicated much of his time and money through his non-profit Chi-Care to feed and help transition unhoused people into permanent living, while simultaneously founding an organization to advocate for survivors of domestic abuse. Junaid Ahmed is a progressive and staunch ally of the less fortunate, and if elected, he would fight against the current, crumbling system which enriches the top 1% at the cost of all of us common people.

## Satnaam Mago for IL State Senate in the 33rd District

[Satnaam Singh Mago](https://www.letsgomago.com/) is a freight broker who understands how interconnected all of our labor is. As a current alternate delegate for the DuPage county democrats, he has seen how corporate PAC influence has corrupted the Democratic Party by shifting them away from their working class priorities. He believes education, healthcare, housing and food are human rights and when elected will champion a proposal to expand vocational and educational course offerings at community colleges, so students can obtain a 4 year bachelor's degree at community colleges for less than it costs for one semester at U of I. Satnaam also believes our Illinois pension plan investments should not be going to finance the genocide in Palestine, but instead to small businesses as a means to protect employee paychecks while allowing the small businesses to grow.

## Ben McAdams for IL State Senate in the 24th District

Ben McAdams is a candidate who will fight back against the Trump administration's use of the national guard to occupy Illinois.  Ben will be the leader we need, someone who will fight to keep ICE out of our communities.  Ben is a strong supporter of universal healthcare and will work to ensure that the state invests in publich healthcare for communities across Illinois.
