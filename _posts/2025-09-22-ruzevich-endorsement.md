Last week, members of the West Suburban Illinois DSA voted to endorse [Joey Ruzevich](https://www.joey4congress.com/) for IL-06. We believe he will fight for the changes the working class desperately need like universal healthcare, a living wage, immigration reform, and an end to genocide and war.

[Join the Democratic Socialists of America](https://www.dsausa.org/join) today to fight for the representation the working class needs. We have the world to win.
