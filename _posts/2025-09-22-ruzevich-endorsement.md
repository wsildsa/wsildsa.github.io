Last week, members of the West Suburban Illinois DSA voted to endorse Joey Ruzevich for IL-06. We believe he will fight for the changes the working class desperately need like universal healthcare, a living wage, immigration reform, and an end to genocide and war. 

Join the Democratic Socialists of America today to win the representation the working class needs. We have the world to win.
