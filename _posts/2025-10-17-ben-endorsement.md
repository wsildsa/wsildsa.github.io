On Wednesday night, voting closed for our October endorsements.  And today, the results are in!  The members of West Suburban IL Democratic Socialists of America have voted to endorse Ben McAdams for IL state senate in the 24th district.  We have already scheduled canvassing events to help support our endorsed candidates on the ground.  Check out our [event calendar](/events) and RSVP today to join the fight against corporate interests and ensure our candidates win!

Ben McAdams is a candidate who will fight back against the Trump administration's use of the national guard to occupy Illinois.  Ben will be the leader we need, someone who will fight to keep ICE out of our communities.  Ben is a strong supporter of universal healthcare and will work to ensure that the state invests in publich healthcare for communities across Illinois.
