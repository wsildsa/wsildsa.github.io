On Wednesday night, voting closed for our October endorsements.  And today, the results are in!  The members of West Suburban IL Democratic Socialists of America have voted to endorse Junaid Ahmed for the IL-08 congressional district.  We have already scheduled canvassing events to help support our endorsed candidates on the ground.  Check out our [event calendar](/events) and RSVP today to join the fight against corporate interests and ensure our candidates win!

[Junaid Ahmed](https://junaidforus.com/) is a husband, father of two, DePaul graduate, and a proud Illinoisian who has been dedicated to giving back to his community throughout his life. He has dedicated much of his time and money through his non-profit Chi-Care to feed and help transition unhoused people into permanent living, while simultaneously founding an organization to advocate for survivors of domestic abuse. Junaid Ahmed is a progressive and staunch ally of the less fortunate, and if elected, he would fight against the current, crumbling system which enriches the top 1% at the cost of all of us common people.
