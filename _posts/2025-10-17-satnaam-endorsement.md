On Wednesday night, voting closed for our October endorsements.  And today, the results are in!  The members of West Suburban IL Democratic Socialists of America have voted to endorse Satnaam Mago for IL state senate in the 33rd district.  We have already scheduled canvassing events to help support our endorsed candidates on the ground.  Check out our [event calendar](/events) and RSVP today to join the fight against corporate interests and ensure our candidates win!

[Satnaam Singh Mago](https://www.letsgomago.com/) is a freight broker who understands how interconnected all of our labor is. As a current alternate delegate for the DuPage county democrats, he has seen how corporate PAC influence has corrupted the Democratic Party by shifting them away from their working class priorities. He believes education, healthcare, housing and food are human rights and when elected will champion a proposal to expand vocational and educational course offerings at community colleges, so students can obtain a 4 year bachelor's degree at community colleges for less than it costs for one semester at U of I. Satnaam also believes our Illinois pension plan investments should not be going to finance the genocide in Palestine, but instead to small businesses as a means to protect employee paychecks while allowing the small businesses to grow.
