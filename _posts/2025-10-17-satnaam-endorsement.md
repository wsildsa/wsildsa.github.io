On Wednesday night, voting closed for our October endorsements.  And today, the results are in!  The members of West Suburban IL Democratic Socialists of America have voted to endorse Satnaam Mago for IL state senate in the 33rd district.  We have already scheduled canvassing events to help support our endorsed candidates on the ground.  Check out our [event calendar](/events) and RSVP today to join the fight against corporate interests and ensure our candidates win!

[Satnaam](https://www.letsgomago.com/) isn't taking any corporate money because it ends up being a bribe. We must keep our communities safe from ICE, make sure all community colleges offer more vocational training as well as 4 year degrees with increased course offerings to lower tuition across the board, and our state pension plan is invested in Illinois rather than Israeli bonds.
