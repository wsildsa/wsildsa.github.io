We are proud to endorse West Suburban IL Democratic Socialists of America member Mahnoor Ahmad in DuPage County Board District 2.

As a child of immigrants and a lifelong public health advocate, [Mahnoor Ahmad](https://mahnoorfordupage.com/) has seen firsthand the challenges that face the working class of DuPage County, such as rising housing costs and limited access to healthcare, especially mental healthcare. Mahnoor is committed to running a people-powered campaign and creating lasting change in the county, and she will fight for residents’ ability to manage the cost of living, protect their homes’ infrastructure, access healthcare, and more easily navigate county services.
