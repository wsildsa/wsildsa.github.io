On Wednesday night, voting closed for our October endorsements.  And today, the results are in!  The members of West Suburban IL Democratic Socialists of America have voted to endorse Junaid Ahmed for the IL-08 congressional district.  We have already scheduled canvassing events to help support our endorsed candidates on the ground.  Check out our [event calendar](/events) and RSVP today to join the fight against corporate interests and ensure our candidates win!

[Junaid Ahmed](https://junaidforus.com/) is a husband, father of four, DePaul graduate, immigrant, and proud Illinoisian who has given back to his community throughout his life. During the pandemic, he founded the non-profit Chi-Care to deliver hot meals and supplies to our unhoused neighbors. Junaid Ahmed is a democratic socialist and when elected, he will fight against the current, crumbling system which enriches the top 1% at the cost of the working class. Junaid is committed to bringing down the cost of healthcare and work towards universal healthcare, to a comprehensive arms embargo of Israel, and to defending immigrant and queer communities from the Trump regime.
